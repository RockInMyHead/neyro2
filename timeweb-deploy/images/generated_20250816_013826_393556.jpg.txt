Create a stunning image of a vibrant bird perched gracefully on a branch. The bird should exhibit intricate feather patterns in a spectrum of colors, including iridescent blues and fiery reds, catching the soft golden light of a late afternoon sun. The background should be a blurred tapestry of lush green foliage, enhancing the vividness of the bird. Employ a shallow depth of field to draw attention to the bird's expressive eyes and delicate beak, capturing the essence of its natural habitat. The overall composition should evoke a sense of tranquility and wonder, reminiscent of a high-quality wildlife photograph. Use a realistic style, with attention to detail in the textures of the feathers and the play of light and shadow.
